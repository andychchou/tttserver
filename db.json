      "text": ["One of the main features of this app/site is to showcase a typical structure of a website built using React, with the theme of this one being table top games. Some of the main features implemented here include:", "1. Bootstrap's responsive grid system - Bootstrap is utilized for the layout of the site's pages, and will responsively change depending on user viewport. Try shrinking the viewport on this page and see if the contents' layout will responsively change to accomodate the viewport size.", "2. React app structure - this site follows a typical react app structure, where components call and render various other components to be shown and subsequent user interaction will update the render of these components. Site data are dynamically stored in a parent component's state and passed down to child components to be used. A large portion of the data (e.g. state) is managed by a Redux store and updated using actions and reducers (more on Redux in a future post).", "3. Very few amounts of the text content are hard-coded in the components, the large majority of the texts shown exist as properties of objects stored in a centralized database location.", "images/postcode.png", "The image above shows how the content of this page is rendered dynamically.", "4. Finally, this site features some simple interactive versions of some table top games, located in the 'Games' section. These games are also built using React, showcasing React's power and flexability. I plan to add some more games in the future as I work on this. The source code for everything can be found in the following GitHub repository:", "https://github.com/andychchou/nutabletopreact"],

Work on the Chess game (currently in progress).", "2. Create an Uno Game.", "3. Create a Monopoly game.", "4. Create a new page, most likely will be something like a 'Store' page to shop for table top games", "As I work on these items on this list, I will periodically make additional blog posts on the progress so far, and eventually I will make another updated to-do list blog post."],

Occasionally, there are also some piece movement situations that happen but are not supposed to be allowed, so I am looking into that to try and fix it.", "Also, there isn't any check condition system at all yet. Check is not indicated at all when it happens, and there's nothing stopping the player from moving into self-check either. This will be another large part of the game that I expect to spend quite some time on.", "So for now, this is what I have completed: ", "1. Board setup", "2. Alternating player turns", "3.
